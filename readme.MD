# End to End testing with Cypress ðŸ§ª 

A school assignment where I was given a code and my task was to write and implement E2E-tests for the program.  
This was my first experience testing with E2E.   
Through the assignment I gained a better understanding of the basics of performing E2E testing and working with Cypress.
